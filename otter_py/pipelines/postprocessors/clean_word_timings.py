"""
Post-processor: Clean Word Timings

Normalizes adjacent word boundaries to remove small overlaps and close tiny gaps.
This improves selection/playback behavior by ensuring word boundaries are "tight"
and consistent.

Algorithm (adjacent words only, assumes time-ordered words):
- If word[i].end > word[i+1].start: clamp overlap by setting both to midpoint.
- If there is a small positive gap (0 < gap < tiny_gap): close it to midpoint.

All time units in the canonical word list are seconds.
Options that take ms are explicitly named *_ms and converted internally.
