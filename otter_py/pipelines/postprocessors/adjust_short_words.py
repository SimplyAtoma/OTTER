Post-processor: Adjust Short Words

Heuristic pass that expands very short words by extending their start time
leftward, without overlapping the previous word.

Motivation:
- Some ASR pipelines produce extremely short word durations (especially
  function words), which can make precise selection and playback difficult.
- This pass trades temporal precision for usability by enforcing a minimum
  effective duration.

This processor operates entirely in word-time space and does not inspect audio.
